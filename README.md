ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm a self-taught iOS Engineer. Here's a bit of what I've been working on.

## Radaro

Radaro provides your business with driver tracking and customer notifications just like Uber and Dominoâ€™s.

Radaro changes the way businesses manage their workforce in real-time on the go, by providing their customers an Uber-like service where customers donâ€™t have to wait unknowingly for a service or a delivery.

Download the Radaro driver app to manage jobs, assist in navigation & communicate with customers.

Our driver app allows you to:

Manage your jobs directly from your iPhone.



Easily navigate to the location of your next job.



Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.
